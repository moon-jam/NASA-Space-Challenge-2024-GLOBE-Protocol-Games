    <h2 id="-">Game Introduction</h2>
        <p>"EcoQuest - Heroes of the GLOBE" is a card-based board game that combines environmental education with mission-based gameplay. Players learn about local and global environmental issues, the scientific spirit, and solve missions by allocating their resource cards. They can earn more points by answering questions related to GLOBE protocol and environmental science knowledge.</p>
    <h2 id="-">Story Background : Scientific Action to Save the Earth</h2>
        <p>The future Earth faces an environmental crisis, with climate change, natural resource depletion, and ecosystem collapse threatening human survival. Environmental organizations, academic institutions, and governments around the world have decided to unite and launch the NASA SPACE program, an international collaborative effort aimed at protecting the Earth. This program is based on the GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) program, calling on global citizens and professionals to work together to take action for the future of our planet.</p>
        <p>As part of the NASA SPACE program, players will take on the roles of environmental heroes from around the world, such as environmental lawyers, Little Mei's Mom, beekeepers, tea farmers, and others. Each character has unique expertise and resources, and they bear the responsibility of saving the environment in their own region. Through collaboration, players will face environmental disasters, manage limited resources, and find solutions to restore Earth's ecosystem in the game.</p>
        <p>In the game, players need to complete a series of environmental protection missions, including purifying polluted water sources, restoring forests, improving urban air quality, and more. These missions are not accomplished by a single player but require close cooperation and resource sharing among different characters. Players must discuss how to effectively allocate their resource cards and make long-term plans to address current environmental problems.</p>
        <p>As the game progresses, the rate of environmental deterioration accelerates, and players will face random threats of natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, or typhoons. These events will affect player progress, forcing them to readjust their strategies. Players need to adapt flexibly and focus resources on the most critical issues to ensure that the Earth's ecosystem can gradually recover.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, when all players successfully complete their environmental missions and effectively control environmental disasters, the Earth's environmental conditions will significantly improve, and the NASA SPACE program's mission will be accomplished. Players will not only enjoy the fun of teamwork in the game but also gain a deeper understanding of the importance of environmental protection.</p>

    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Recommended Player Count: 4-6 players</li>
        <li>Recommended Age: 8 years old and up</li>
        <li>Average Playtime: 30-60 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="-">Card Overview</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Character Cards</strong>: Each player chooses a character, each with a special ability.  </li>
        <li><strong>Mission Cards</strong>: These cards represent environmental protection tasks players need to complete in the game. Each terrain has a main objective for missions, players can explain which objective the mission they want to undertake belongs to. If other players agree with their explanation, it is considered reasonable. Otherwise, players must choose other missions and re-explain to other players. If there is no mission card that matches the terrain, a **Special Situation** will be triggered.<br>Each card includes the following elements:  <ul>
        <li><strong>Mission Name</strong>: E.g., "Clean Up River Pollution" or "Monitor Rainfall".  </li>
        <li><strong>Resources Needed</strong>: The number of resource cards required to complete the mission (e.g., water resource cards, soil resource cards, etc.).  </li>
        <li><strong>Science Challenge</strong>: Some missions require answering science questions or answering questions based on science knowledge cards (this helps with education and learning).  </li>
        <li><strong>Rewards</strong>: Upon successful completion of the mission, players will earn points and resources.  </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Resource Cards</strong>: Include various natural resources  </li>
        <li><strong>Event Cards</strong>: One event card is drawn at the end of each turn. These events can be natural disasters, climate change, or pollution incidents. Events can:  <ul>
        <li>Affect the resource supply in an area (e.g., "Drought reduces water resources").  </li>
        <li>Force players to deal with challenges, otherwise resources or points will be lost.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="-">Gameplay</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Game Start</strong>:  <ol>
        <li>Each player chooses a character and places the chosen character at the map's starting point  </li>
        <li>Each player takes five resource cards as starting resources  </li>
        <li>Draw out a number of mission cards equal to the number of players and lay them out on the table  </li>
        <li>Decide freely who starts first.  </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Players can discuss collaboration before the start of each round</strong>  </li>
        <li><strong>Turn Progression</strong>:  <ol>
        <li>If a player has enough resource cards in their hand to complete a mission on the table, they activate the card's influence based on their current terrain, draw a new mission card to replace the original one.<br>(Special Situation: If none of the current mission cards match the current terrain, then the mission cannot be completed in that turn, the next player continues playing, they can still draw a resource card; if there is **no** mission card that matches the terrain, then redraw five mission cards to replace them, and all players **move back one terrain**, if they are already on the initial terrain, they return to the starting point.  </li>
        <li>After solving the mission, the player answers. After completing the mission, they can scan the QR code on the mission card, which contains a bonus question. If the player answers correctly, they can move forward one space, answering incorrectly will not result in any penalties (character's own skill influence is not included here)  </li>
        <li>Before the end of the turn, the player draws a new resource card.  </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Game End</strong>: When a player reaches the finish line, the game ends. Players share their knowledge about the environment and their experience in solving problems learned during the game.</li>

        <h3 id="-">Example Explanation</h3>
        <p>(Using your role as <strong>Little Mei's Mom</strong> as an example, and assuming 5 players are playing)</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the game, the number of resource cards: 1 water resource, 2 biological resources, 1 labor resource, and 1 scientific knowledge resource.</p>
        <p>The initial area is : <strong>Coastal Area</strong></p>
        <p>The initial five mission cards : Air Quality Monitoring, Forest Protection and Monitoring, Agricultural Water Management, Ecological Protection and Monitoring, Climate Change Impact Analysis.</p>
        <p>The missions that can be conducted in this terrain are : Ocean Garbage Cleanup, Coastal Protection, Climate Change Impact Analysis.</p>
        <p>At this time, only <strong>Climate Change Impact Analysis</strong> can be conducted on the table, so conduct <strong>Biodiversity Survey</strong>, which requires <strong>2 Biological Resources, 1 Scientific Knowledge Resource</strong>. After completing the mission, you will earn 7 spaces forward and 1 Plant Resource Card.</p>
        <p>At this time, Little Mei's Mom is in the second space of the Forest Area, and the resources in her hand are: 1 Water Resource, 1 Plant Resource, 1 Labor Resource.</p>
        <p>After several rounds, Little Mei's Mom arrives at the final area <strong>Agricultural Area</strong>. At this time, the remaining resource cards in her hand are 1 Water Resource and 1 Energy Resource. The mission she wants to undertake is <strong>Agricultural Water Management</strong>, which requires 2 Water Resources and 1 Energy Resource. Although there is one less Water Resource, Little Mei's Mom's special ability allows her to consume one less Water Resource and Plant Resource when performing missions. Therefore, Little Mei's Mom has enough resources to complete the mission and successfully wins the game.</p>
