## Card Overview

1. **Character Cards:** Each player chooses a character, each with a special ability.
2. **Mission Cards:** These cards represent environmental protection tasks players need to complete in the game. Each terrain has a main objective for missions, players can explain which objective the mission they want to undertake belongs to. If other players agree with their explanation, it is considered reasonable. Otherwise, players must choose other missions and re-explain to other players. If there is no mission card that matches the terrain, a **Special Situation** will be triggered.
   Each card includes the following elements:
   - **Mission Name:** E.g., "Clean Up River Pollution" or "Monitor Rainfall."
   - **Resources Needed:** The number of resource cards required to complete the mission (e.g., water resource cards, soil resource cards, etc.).
   - **Science Challenge:** Some missions require answering science questions or answering questions based on science knowledge cards (this helps with education and learning).
   - **Rewards:** Upon successful completion of the mission, players will earn points and resources.
3. **Resource Cards:** Include various natural resources
4. **Event Cards:** One event card is drawn at the end of each turn. These events can be natural disasters, climate change, or pollution incidents. Events can:
   - Affect the resource supply in an area (e.g., "Drought reduces water resources").
   - Force players to deal with challenges, otherwise resources or points will be lost.

## Gameplay

1. **Game Start:**
   1. Each player chooses a character and places the chosen character at the map's starting point.
   2. Each player takes five resource cards as starting resources.
   3. Draw a number of mission cards equal to the number of players and lay them out on the table.
   4. Decide freely who starts first.
2. **Players can discuss collaboration before the start of each round.**
3. **Turn Progression:**
   1. If a player has enough resource cards in their hand to complete a mission on the table, they activate the card's influence based on their current terrain, draw a new mission card to replace the original one.
      (Special Situation: If none of the current mission cards match the current terrain, then the mission cannot be completed in that turn, the next player continues playing, they can still draw a resource card; if there is **no** mission card that matches the terrain, then redraw five mission cards to replace them, and all players **move back one terrain**, if they are already on the initial terrain, they return to the starting point.)
   2. After solving the mission, the player answers. After completing the mission, they can scan the QR code on the mission card, which contains a bonus question. If the player answers correctly, they can move forward one space, answering incorrectly will not result in any penalties (character's own skill influence is not included here).
   3. Before the end of the turn, the player draws a new resource card.
4. **Game End:** When a player reaches the finish line, the game ends. Players share their knowledge about the environment and their experience in solving problems learned during the game.

## Example Explanation

(Using the character **Little Mei's Mom** as an example, and assuming 5 players are playing)

At the beginning of the game, the number of resource cards: 1 water resource, 2 biological resources, 1 labor resource, and 1 scientific knowledge resource.

The initial area is: **Coastal Area**

The initial 5 mission cards: Air Quality Monitoring, Forest Protection and Monitoring, Agricultural Water Management, Ecological Protection and Monitoring, Climate Change Impact Analysis.

The missions that can be conducted in this terrain are: Ocean Garbage Cleanup, Coastal Protection, Climate Change Impact Analysis.

At this time, only **Climate Change Impact Analysis** can be conducted on the table, so conduct **Biodiversity Survey**, which requires **2 Biological Resources, 1 Scientific Knowledge Resource**. After completing the mission, you will earn 7 spaces forward and 1 Plant Resource Card.

At this time, Little Mei's Mom is in the second space of the Forest Area, and the resources in her hand are: 1 Water Resource, 1 Plant Resource, 1 Labor Resource.

After several rounds, Little Mei's Mom arrives at the final area **Agricultural Area**. At this time, the remaining resource cards in her hand are 1 Water Resource and 1 Energy Resource. The mission she wants to undertake is **Agricultural Water Management**, which requires 2 Water Resources and 1 Energy Resource. Although there is one less Water Resource, Little Mei's Mom's special ability allows her to consume one less Water Resource and Plant Resource when performing missions. Therefore, Little Mei's Mom has enough resources to complete the mission and successfully wins the game.
